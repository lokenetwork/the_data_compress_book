* In order for the compressor to build the same model, I have to

* unconditionally. The format used to store counts looks like this:
*
* start, stop, counts, start, stop, counts, ... 0
*
* This means that I store runs of counts, until all the non-zero
* counts have been stored. At this time the list is terminated by
* storing a start value of 0. Note that at least 1 run of counts has
* to be stored, so even if the first start value is 0, I read it in.
* It also means that even in an empty file that has no counts, I have
* to pass at least one count, which will have a value of 0.
*
* In order to efficiently use this format, I have to identify runs of
* non-zero counts. Because of the format used, I don't want to stop a
* run because of just one or two zeros in the count stream. So I have
* to sit in a loop looking for strings of three or more zero values
* in a row.
*
* This is simple in concept, but it ends up being one of the most
* complicated routines in the whole program. A routine that just
